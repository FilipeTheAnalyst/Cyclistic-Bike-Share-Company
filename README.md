# Case Study: Help a bike-share company to convert casual riders into annual members
In this article i showcase my approach to solve the case study of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project.

As I learned from the Google Data Analytics program, I will the six phases of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**, **share and act**.

### About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

### Business Task
To answer this problem: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differenty?**

### Ask
Three questions need to be answered:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

### Prepare
In this phase, I collected the data organized in monthly .csv files from this source [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). 
I downloaded the files from 2021 to perform this analysis.

#### Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data?
The data is from last year and is collected by a bike-share company directly. It includes all rides, so it's not a sample from the whole data. Therefore, it's possible to conclude that there are no credibility and bias issues with this data.

#### How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?
The data is under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). There are no privacy concerns since the data does not contain personal information.

### Process
In this phase, I used R to perform the data cleaning.

### Analyze, Share and Act
All these steps were performed using Tableau, it can be acessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/filipe7270/viz/Cyclistic_16429571092230/StoryBike-Sharing)
